## üìç Project Scopes 


The project will deliver the following:  

1. A microservice (**Microservice A**) that simulates sensors by generating data records with the following fields:  
   - Sensor value (float)  
   - Sensor type (string)  
   - Device code (renamed from ID1, alphabets in capital letters)  
   - Device number (renamed from ID2, integer)  
   - Timestamp  

2. The frequency of data generation can be configured through a REST API endpoint.  

3. Multiple instances of **Microservice A** can run at the same time, with each instance producing data for only one fixed sensor type (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure).  

4. Another microservice (**Microservice B**) will be created to receive and process the data stream from Microservice A using gRPC, MQTT, or an equivalent protocol.  

5. **Microservice B** will compile and store the received data in a MySQL database in a structured format, making it easy to manage and retrieve.  

6. **Microservice B** will provide REST API endpoints to:  
   - Retrieve data based on device code and device number.  
   - Retrieve data based on a time range.  
   - Retrieve data based on a combination of device identifiers and timestamps.  
   - Edit and delete data using the same filtering options.  
   - Support pagination when retrieving large sets of data.  

7. Authentication and authorization will be implemented to ensure secure access to the API endpoints.  

8. **Microservice B** will be designed to handle input from multiple Microservice A instances simultaneously and support scalability as the number of devices grows.  

9. The system will be tested by running many instances of **Microservice A** to push the scalability limits of **Microservice B**.

## ‚ö° Assumptions  


- Sensors are simulated and not connected to real hardware.  
- Device code will be randomly generated from A‚ÄìZ.  
- Device number from sensor data will be randomly generated in the range of 1‚Äì1000 and cannot be zero.  
- Sensor data generation starts automatically when the service runs and continues until shutdown, with APIs available to manually start or stop the process.  
- Sensor value will be randomly generated based on the sensor type and within the possible range for that sensor type.  
- Sensor data is produced at regular intervals (default: 5 seconds) and generated from multiple instances.  
- The regular interval for producing sensor data cannot be less than 5 seconds.  
- A login process is required before accessing features such as viewing, editing, or deleting sensor data.  
- The system defines two roles: **admin** and **user**. Admins can view, edit, and delete data, while users are limited to viewing and editing only. Since deletion carries higher risk, it is restricted to admins.  
- A registration feature is available to create new users by providing a username, password, and role for simplicity the input. Meantime, registration must be completed before login.  
- Sensor data can be retrieved through a single API that supports filtering (by device code, device number, start time, and end time) and pagination (page and limit).  
- Sensor data can be deleted or updated using filtering, with restrictions:  
  - Deletion or update cannot occur if the start time is later than the end time.  
  - Deletion or update cannot be performed without a filter.  
- For the update feature, only specific fields can be modified: **sensor type**, **sensor value**, and **timestamp**.

## üèóÔ∏è Software Architecture

![Software Architecture Schematic Diagram](docs/software_architecture/software_architecture_schematic_diagram.svg)


### Architecture Diagram Overview

This schematic illustrates a microservice-based IoT sensor data processing system designed for scalability and high performance. The architecture follows a clean separation of concerns with distinct layers for data generation, message streaming, processing, and storage.


**Key Data Flow**
- Data Generation ‚Üí Multiple Microservice A instances generate sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure) with configurable frequencies through REST APIs.

- Message Streaming ‚Üí Apache Kafka handles high-throughput data streaming between producers and consumers, ensuring reliable message delivery.

- Data Processing ‚Üí Scalable Microservice B cluster processes incoming Kafka streams, implements JWT authentication, and provides comprehensive REST APIs for CRUD operations.

- Storage ‚Üí MySQL database stores sensor data with advanced filtering capabilities by ID combinations, time ranges, and pagination support.


**Current Implementation**
The system is containerized with Docker for local development and uses JWT authentication for secure API access. Components marked as "Not implemented yet" (API Gateway, Redis Cache, Kubernetes, Monitoring) represent planned enhancements for future development.

## üóÑ Database Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)


The following Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) illustrates the database structure for sensor platform spesifically on **Microservice B**:

![Sensor ERD](docs/erd/sensor_erd.svg)

### Table Structure Overview

**sensor_data Table (Blue)**
- *Purpose*: Stores IoT sensor readings and measurements
- *Primary Key*: id (BIGINT) - uniquely identifies each sensor reading
- *Core Data*: Contains sensor type, measured values, and device identification
- *Key Fields*:
  - sensor_type: What kind of sensor (temperature, humidity, etc.)
  - sensor_value: The actual measurement reading
  - device_code & device_number: Identify which physical device sent the data
  - timestamp: When the reading was taken


| Column | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | BIGINT | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique identifier for each sensor reading |
| `sensor_type` | VARCHAR(50) | NOT NULL | Type of sensor (e.g., temperature, humidity, pressure) |
| `sensor_value` | DOUBLE | NOT NULL | The actual measurement value from the sensor |
| `device_code` | VARCHAR(20) | NOT NULL | Alphanumeric code identifying the device |
| `device_number` | INT | NOT NULL | Numeric identifier for the device |
| `timestamp` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | When the sensor reading was recorded |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Record creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL, DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE | Last modification timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMP | NULL | Soft delete timestamp (NULL = active record) |


**users Table (Green)**
- *Purpose*: Manages user authentication and access control
- *Primary Key*: id (INT) - uniquely identifies each user
- *Core Data*: User credentials and role-based permissions
- *Key Fields*:
  - username: Unique login identifier
  - password: Encrypted authentication credential
  - role: Access level (admin or regular user)

| Column | Data Type | Constraints | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| `id` | INT | PRIMARY KEY, AUTO_INCREMENT | Unique identifier for each user |
| `username` | VARCHAR(50) | NOT NULL, UNIQUE | User login identifier |
| `password` | VARCHAR(255) | NOT NULL | Encrypted password hash |
| `role` | ENUM('admin', 'user') | NOT NULL, DEFAULT 'user' | User access level |
| `created_at` | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Account creation timestamp |
| `updated_at` | TIMESTAMP | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE | Last profile update timestamp |
| `deleted_at` | TIMESTAMP | NULL | Soft delete timestamp (NULL = active account) |


### Key Features

**üîê Security & Access Control**
- **Role-based permissions**: Users can be either 'admin' or 'user'
- **Unique usernames**: Prevents duplicate accounts
- **Password encryption**: Stored as hashed values for security

**üìà Data Integrity**
- **Primary keys**: Each table has a unique identifier
- **NOT NULL constraints**: Critical fields cannot be empty
- **Auto-increment**: Automatic ID generation for new records

**üïí Audit Trail**
Both tables implement comprehensive audit logging:
- **created_at**: Tracks when records are first added
- **updated_at**: Automatically updates when records are modified
- **deleted_at**: Implements soft delete (records marked as deleted but not physically removed)

**üì° IoT Data Management**
The sensor_data table is optimized for high-volume IoT data:
- **BIGINT primary key**: Supports billions of sensor readings
- **Device identification**: Dual identifiers (code + number) for flexible device management
- **Flexible sensor types**: VARCHAR field accommodates various sensor categories
- **Precise timestamps**: Ensures accurate temporal data tracking

**This ERD represents the current database structure. Future iterations may include additional tables and relationships to support enhanced functionality.**

## üöÄ Setup & Run

1. **Clone the repository**
   Clone the project and open it in your preferred IDE or code editor
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vincentweilasto16/sensor-platform.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   Make sure Go is installed, then install the required dependencies:
   
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go mod vendor
   ```
   
3. **Set up environment variables**
   Before building or running the project, create a `.env` file from the example:
   
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
4. Start Docker Daemon
   Ensure Docker is running on your machine. The project includes a docker-compose.yml file that defines all required services:
   - Zookeeper
   - Kafka
   - MySQL
   - Microservice B (Data Receiver & API)
   - Microservice A instances (Temperature, Humidity, Pressure)

5. Prepare the database
   Before running all services, make sure MySQL is ready and the database exists:

   1. **Build and start MySQL**

      Start only the MySQL service using Docker Compose:
   
      ```bash
      docker compose up mysql
      ```

      > This will build and start the MySQL container using the credentials defined in your `.env` file (`DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_PORT`).

   2. **Connect to MySQL**
      
      Once the container is running, connect to MySQL using your preferred client (e.g., MySQL CLI, TablePlus, DBeaver) with the following details:
      
      - **Host:** `localhost`  
      - **Port:** `${DB_PORT}` (from `.env`)  
      - **Username:** `${DB_USER}`  
      - **Password:** `${DB_PASSWORD}`  

      > Ensure the connection is successful before proceeding.

   3. **Create the database**
      
      After a successful connection, create the database defined in your `.env` file (`DB_NAME`) if it doesn‚Äôt already exist:

      ```sql
      CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS your_db_name;
      ```

6. Start All Services
   Build and start all services:
   
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   
   - Database migration runs automatically after Microservice B starts.
   - Kafka topic (sensor-topic) is automatically created during the Docker build.
   - Sensor data generation starts automatically once all services are running.
